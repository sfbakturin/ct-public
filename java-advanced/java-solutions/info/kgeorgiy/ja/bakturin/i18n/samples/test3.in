This is a story about a man named Harold Crick. And his wristwatch.
Harold Crick was a man of infinite numbers endless calculations and remarkably few words. And his wristwatch said even less.
Every weekday, for 12 years Harold would brush each of his 32 teeth 76 times. 38 times back and forth.
38 times up and down. Every weekday, for 12 years Harold would tie his tie in a single Windsor knot instead of the double thereby saving up to 43 seconds.
His wristwatch thought the single Windsor made his neck look fat but said nothing.
Every weekday, for 12 years Harold would run at a rate of nearly barely catching the 817 Kronecker bus.
His wristwatch would delight in the feeling of the crisp wind rushing over its face.
And every weekday, for 12 years Harold would review 7134 tax files as a senior agent for the Internal Revenue Service.
Harold, 89 times 1417? 7 minute for lunch break and a 4.3 minute for coffee break timed precisely by his wristwatch.

# FAA-based queue

In this task, you will implement a concurrent queue that leverages the `Fetch-and-Add` synchronization primitive. The high-level design of this queue bases on a conceptually infinite array for storing elements and manipulates `enqIdx` and `deqIdx` counters, which reference the next working cells in the infinite array for `enqueue(..)` and `dequeue()` operations. The infinite array implementation is usually simulated via a linked list of fixed-size segments. The overall algorithm should be at least obstruction-free.

The task consists of two parts. You first need to implement the queue with a provided infinite array data structure in [`src/FAABasedQueueSimplified.kt`](src/FAABasedQueueSimplified.kt), implementing the full algorithm in [`src/FAABasedQueue.kt`](src/FAABasedQueue.kt) after that.

# Stack with Elimination

In this task, you need to implement a modified version of the classic Treiber concurrent stack algorithm, which optimizes `push(..)`-s and `pop()`-s under high contention via the *elimination* technique.

The task consists of two parts. You first need to implement the classic Treiber stack algorithm in [`src/TreiberStack.kt`](src/TreiberStack.kt), adding the elimination technique in  [`src/TreiberStackWithElimination.kt`](src/TreiberStackWithElimination.kt).

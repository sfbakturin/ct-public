# Parallel Dijkstra Algorithm

In this task, you need to implement a parallel version of the state-of-the-art Dijkstra algorithm for the SSSP graph problem. Use the Multi-Queue design for the priority queue implementation. Use `Compare-and-Set` to update the `Node`-s distance.

Note that you are eligible to change only the `src/Dijkstra.kt` file.
